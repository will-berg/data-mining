# Introduction
The problem of discovering association rules between itemsets in a sales transaction database (a set of baskets) includes the following two sub-problems

1. Finding frequent itemsets with support at least $s$.
2. Generating association rules with confidence at least $c$ from the itemsets found in the first step.

Reminder that an association rule is an implication $X \implies Y$, where $X$ and $Y$ are itemsets such that $X \cap Y = âˆ…$. Support of rule $X \implies Y$ is the number of transactions that contain $X \cup Y$. Confidence of rule $X \implies Y$ is the fraction of transactions containing $X \cup Y$ in all transactions that contain $X$.

# Task
You are to solve the first sub-problem: to implement the A-Priori algorithm for finding frequent itemsets with support at least $s$ in a dataset of sales transactions. Remind that support of an itemset is the number of transactions containing the itemset. To test and evaluate your implementation, write a program that uses your A-Priori algorithm implementation to discover frequent itemsets with support at least $s$ in a given dataset of sales transactions.

## Optional Task
Solve the second sub-problem, i.e., develop and implement an algorithm for generating association rules between frequent itemsets discovered using the A-Priori algorithm in a dataset of sales transactions. The rules must have the support of at least $s$ and confidence of at least $c$, where $s$ and $c$ are given as input parameters.
