# Report - Homework 2: Discovery of Frequent Itemsets and Association Rules

## Implementation
Short description of your solution

## Running the Program
Instructions on how to build and run
Default values

The requested functionality of the homework is implemented in the `functions.py` file. These functions are called to execute the program itself in the `main.py` file. Running the program is thus very easy:
```bash
$ python main.py
```
Keep in mind that before running the program the data needs to be available at the path `data/transactions.dat`. The dataset can be retrieved [here](https://canvas.kth.se/courses/42990/files/6945385). By default, the support threshold is set to 1000 (1% of the baskets) and confidence is set to 0.5. Verbose is also set to `False`, which means that the resulting print out of the program will be less verbose than if it were set to `True`. These values can be adjusted in the `main.py` file.
